# How to contribute

To contribute you will need a GitHub account, if you do not already have one
click [here](https://github.com/) to sign up.

## Small online edits

At the top of every tutorial document there is a link to the online GitHub
repository where the document is stored. Clicking will take you to the
GitHub website; you can edit this document directly by clicking on the edit
button:

![edit-button][edit-button]

Clicking on the edit button will show a raw text version of the Markdown file.
At the top, it will say that you have created a fork of the repo. You can make
your changes and then preview them to check the document will be parsed as you
expect it. To learn how to write Markdown code check the Markdown
tutorial [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/introduction_to_markdown).

Once you've made your changes and you're happy with them, you need to propose
them to the docs repo. To do this, at the bottom of the page you will see a
'Propose file change' section, you simply need to write a short and optional
extended description of the changes you made to the document and then click
'Propose file change.'

Your change will then be seen by one of the 'docs-keepers' (the people that
organise and maintain the docs repo). They will review the change and may start
a discussion via GitHub if they have any questions about the change. If accepted,
the change will be merged with the docs repo and will appear on the website
within one or two days.

And that's it!

## Large online edits

For more substantial edits which cannot be done in a single sitting, or to add
your own documents you will need to fork the docs repo to your own GitHub
account. Clicking the edit button on one of the files in the docs repo will do
this automatically, but you can also click the fork button from the repo
homepage:
